my-js-tricks
============

Some JavaScript utility functions I use for my developments.

These come from 3 origins : 
  - JavaScript: the good parts, the excellent book by D. Crockford.
  - Influences of other programming languages, such as Clojure and Scala.
  - My own inspiration, as I try to refactor my programs.
